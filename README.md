## Personal Note

I developed this project a while ago and almost forgot to share it! However, with India's incredible World Cup victory yesterday, it felt like the perfect moment to celebrate and showcase this little piece of cricket-inspired code. It's a reminder of how much fun it is to build things and how even small projects can bring joy, especially when tied to such a momentous occasion!
